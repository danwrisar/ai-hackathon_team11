# Navigating guidelines with Bots

## Team 11

In the NHS, trusts have many different guidelines they use to influence patient care. These guidelines advise on a vast number of medical conditions. The contents of these guidelines are often life critical and time dependent.  At present the storing of these guidelines varies from trust to trust. Some have large paper folders, others have documents on the intranet and others have a shared-drive that houses different guidelines; But is this the most effective and accessible way to store trust guidelines?  We feel that AI could provide a quicker, sleeker and more efficient way to retrieve information from trust guidelines.  
 
In the hackathon we will use guidelines about the use of blood thinners in endoscopy in order to train our AI. We want to use a chatbot function to retrieve specific information about blood thinners from the trust guideline in order to facilitate quick and accurate information in clinical settings.
 
No longer will clinicians have to route through pages and pages of paper documents or irrelevant information on the  intranet or shared drives. With this technology they will be able to get  relevant, specific and accurate in real time. This could be applied to all trust guidelines and really would revolutionise a real-life problem seen in the NHS.
